This is the app I am using currently for voice input.
Let's test out how good this is. 

## Install

Installed via https://github.com/Beingpax/VoiceInk

```sh
brew install --cask voiceink
```

## Model

We tested the Quantized v3 model vs Gemini 2.5 Flash.
The quantized model was slow the first time, but much faster after.
Gemini is both slow and somewhat inaccurate. 
So we reverted to the quantized local model.
